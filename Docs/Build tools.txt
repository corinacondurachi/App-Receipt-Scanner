Build Tools

Our project is made using Andorid Studio IDE that has a Gradle-based building tool
When we want to build our project in an APK, so that we can give it to our users to install the application and use it,
we go to 
[SS1]
and click Build APK
Then, in the folder our project is in, it generates 2 files:
[SS2]
One of the file, "app-debug.apk", is the apk that will install our application, the other one, "output.json", is a message that tells
us if the apk was generated succesfully or not

We then transfer the APK to our mobile device and run it to install the application
